                <p>This was an assignment for our UI class that I enjoyed doing. The goal was to recreate the pexels website as close as we possibly can, and here is my attempt.
                Using grid was something new but as I did the assignment it got easier and it was great to learn.

                <p>I love the way Facebook came to be, it started off as Facemash. 
                    It was for students to compare other students by their picutres side by side, but now it helps connect people all over the world. 
                    It also statred off in the students dorm. 
                    I admire how they manage to keep the load up time fast despite the amout of people using facebook uploading pictures, posts, and more.
                    The user interface is pretty friendly for new users which is helpful if you are trying to help someone else use it.
